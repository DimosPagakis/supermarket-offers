"""Lidl Hellas listing-page parser.

Lidl renders weekly offer pages at URLs like
``/c/evdomadiaies-epiloges-26kw22/a10095458`` (or themed variants such
as ``/c/poiotita-poikilia-26kw22/...``). Every product card on the
listing embeds its full domain model in a ``data-grid-data`` HTML
attribute as HTML-entity-encoded JSON. That JSON is the source of
truth — it contains structured prices, validity windows, discount
percentages, images, canonical URLs, and packaging strings.

We parse that JSON instead of chasing CSS selectors over the rendered
DOM because:
  * It's vastly more stable across UI rebrands.
  * It already separates current price / old price / discount, which
    saves us from heuristically diffing strike-through text.
  * It carries machine-readable ``startDate`` / ``endDate`` which map
    cleanly to the backend's ``valid_from`` / ``valid_to`` columns.

Price-block shapes observed in the wild
---------------------------------------
A single card can expose its price under one of two siblings of
``regionsPrices.<region>``:

* ``currentPrice``: a single object — used once the promotion has
  *started*. This is what live, in-flight offers look like.
* ``futurePrices``: a list of objects each wrapping ``price`` — used
  for upcoming promotions that haven't started yet.

Both inner ``price`` blocks share the same field layout (``price``,
``oldPrice``, ``discount.percentageDiscount``, ``packaging.text``,
``startDate`` / ``endDate``, ``currencyCode`` …), so we normalise on
the first available block. Historically only ``futurePrices`` was
checked — that quietly dropped the entire current-week catalogue once
the Thursday rollover flipped offers from "future" to "current"
(observed 2026-05-25: every kw22 evdomadiaies card moved to
``currentPrice`` and the spider's priced-offer count collapsed from
~85 to ~27). See ``crawler/tests/test_lidl_parser.py`` for both
shapes pinned against committed fixtures.
